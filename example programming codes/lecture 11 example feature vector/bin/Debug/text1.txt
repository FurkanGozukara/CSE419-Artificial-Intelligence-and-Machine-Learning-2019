The future is bright for computer science graduates or professionals, but more so for those with graduate degrees in the field. Knowledge and expertise in computer science is crucial in todayâ€™s economy, marked by rapid technological advances.

The US Bureau of Labor and Statistics notes that employment of computer and information research scientists is projected to grow 16 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. They add that computer scientists are likely to enjoy excellent job prospects as many companies report difficulties in finding highly skilled workers.

As technology continues to evolve at an accelerated pace, the demand for computer science professionals who have the capabilities to not only cope, but progress with its advancements is crucial to stay competitive in our global job market. As newer forms of technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), become mainstream, graduates will want to keep abreast of new developments in the field.

Those looking to enhance their career prospects, be it in academia, research or across various businesses, industrial or even governmental, will find acquiring advanced knowledge of computer theory and technology highly useful. The US has long been home to many top institutions that specialise in the field, making it an attractive option for international students. For instance, a report from digital mortgage broker Mojo Mortgages has found that most unicorn (tech startups valued at US$1 billion) company founders studied at US universities.

If your interest is piqued, here are four public US universities that are producing the next generation of leaders in computer science:

DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT DALLAS
Located in the Dallas Metroplex in Texas, the University of Texas at Dallas has one of the largest Computer Science Departments in the US, with 3,315 undergraduate students, 1,110 masters students, 165 PhD students, 50 tenure-track faculty members, 44 full-time instructional faculty and over 500 part-time student employees. It offers nearly 300 course-sections that cover almost every area of computer science and software engineering.

The UT Dallas Computer Science Department faculty are engaged in cutting edge research funded by the National Science Foundation, DARPA, Department of Defense, and industry to the tune of nearly $9 million per year. The department is particularly strong in AI, machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), data science, software engineering, cybersecurity, theory, systems and networking. As a testament to its prowess, UT Dallas has many accolades under its belt, including being ranked 5th in the US for AI undergraduate studies by Great Value Colleges, 7th in US for NLP research, 11th in US for AI research and 5th in US for software engineering research on csrankings.org.
